# coffee-consumption
My final version for dealing with coffee consumption problem

The problem was from an online assessment, and at that time, I was unable to solve it. Later, I tried again.

The question asked the candidate to write a program that could read the vectors of strings representing coffee consumption for every month in three different cities and then report the average coffee consumption for each city in a given month.
